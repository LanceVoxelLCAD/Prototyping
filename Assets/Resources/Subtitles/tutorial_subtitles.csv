intro1,"Hey! Welcome back! So, you’re half dead. If you look to your left - ah, your other left - Yeah, sure - You’ll see your body. Looks pretty dead, right? But no worries - you’re only half dead. And if you do one little thing for us, as easy as changing a lightbulb, we’ll get you back in your meatsuit in a jiff.",6
intro2,"Let’s start by walking around, yeah? See, dying - or half dying - tends to do a number on.. Well.. everything. Your body and mind, yadda yadda. You - You do remember how to walk, right?",6
intro3,"Great. Great. Now, how about jumping. There’s a little obstacle in front of you. Jump over that.",6
intro4,"Good job! See? You’ve got this. So, this is a hallway - you remember those, right? They’re pretty long.",6
intro5,"Now for the fun stuff. Being half dead, you’re made of ghost stuff. We call it “Resin.” Short for “resin-due.” Get it? Well, whatever.",6
intro6,"Resin is great for EVERYTHING. Power, mostly, but that’s what got us into this mess. Years ago… Oh, you don’t need a history lesson, you’ll remember when you’re alive again.",6
intro7,"Here’re the sparknotes: You’re kinda dead, and a lot of other people are in the same boat, but.. Permanently. We use them for energy. And now you will, too!",6
intro8,"See that? That’s the T.O.R.C.H. The Total.. Obliteration.. Resin.. Charge.. H..Thing. I don’t remember what it stands for, but let’s pretend it’s that.",6
intro9,"Hit the left trigger to fire the beam, which fires concentrated resin-due. It’s a medium range power beam that can melt baddies. Why don’t you try it out on these test guys?",6
intro10,Good job killing those guys. They were probably jerks.,6
intro11,"You probably noticed the resin-due gage dropping when you fired. No worries, though - the T.O.R.C.H. passively refills your resin-due overtime, soaking it up from the environment and, uh, keeping you half-dead instead of full-dead. So don’t lose it.",6
intro12,"You can also quickly refill your gauges quickly with canisters. You can find these in the environment if you look around, or they’re sometimes dropped by ghosts. Yellow ones refill your resin-due and red ones are good for your health. Other colors can be used to give your TORCH permanent upgrades, so keep an eye out!",6
intro13,"Now, you’re probably thinking that you’re kinda trapped here. But actually - you’re not! See that ledge up there? Yeah? Glad your eyes still work. Your TORCH has two modes: beam and foam. Switch it now.",6
intro14,"So that green stuff on the wall - that’s ghost foam. It’s actually just the resin-due, which foams up and hardens into a platform you can stand on. Place it there on the wall below the staircase, and then jump on it and up to the next area.",6
intro15,"Ah, there’s a real baddie down there. Careful now. You can either engage him head on, or you can bypass him entirely. Up to you.",6
intro16,"Nicely done. Now, here’s the good news: You’re getting close to the end. The end of what? Well, the safe zone, where living people still live.",6
intro17,"You’re going into the Haunted Zone - the fun little spot we shove all the ghosts to keep using as an infinite energy source. Problem is, all the walls and gates can only do so much. We really need to get them there, first. For this - there’s the Lighthouse.",6
intro18,"The Lighthouse is an ectoplasmically charged, resin-due powered, state of the art piece of equipment, which draws ghosts from all over into the haunted zone, and keeps them there! Or, it did. Now it’s falling apart.",6
intro19,"But.. remember that little favor I asked for? Being half-dead, you’ve got your wits about you, AND you can walk around in the Haunted Zone, so.. We need you to go to the Lighthouse, and we need you to change the light bulb. Literally. You can change a light bulb, right?",6
intro20,"Okay, well - this is the wall of the haunted zone now, so - good luck! And, uh, try not to die. I’m sick of giving this stupid speech all the time…",6
